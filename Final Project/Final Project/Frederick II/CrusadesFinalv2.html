            <p class="red">Frederick had a particular passion for astronomy, astrology, geography, zoology, medicine, and human anatomy.</p>
            <p class="blue">His nickname from Matthew Paris was "<i>Stupor mundi</i>"<a href="#ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> meaning "the marvel of the world" for his dedication to the arts and sciences.</p>
            <p class="red">He often to reached out to Christain, Muslim, Jewish, and Mongol scholars to expand his knowledge.</p>

                <h3>
                    <p class="blue">One of Fredericks' most prized possessions was his planetarium from the Sultan of Damascus, al-Ashraf.</p>
                    <p class="red">The earliest description of the planetarium comes from “<i>Chronica Regia Coloniensis</i>”<a href="#ref2"><sup>2</sup></a> stating:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p class="blue">A wondrous art-built pavilion, in which images of the sun and moon, moving by art, traverse their orbit at regular intervals, and infallibly indicate the hours of day and night.<p>
                            <p class="red">The value of this tent is said to have exceeded the price of twenty thousand marks.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                    <p class="blue">Below is an interactive demo of what the stars on the interor of the planetarium may have looked like.</p>

                <h4>
                    <p class="red">Besides his intrest in the stars Frederick had a burning passion for training birds, specifically hunting birds like falcons and eagles.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="blue">His intrest in birds was so big he wrote a six book collection on bird species, training birds, and hunting with birds called "<i>De Arte Venandi Cum Avibus</i>"<a href="#ref4"><sup>4</sup></a> or "On the Art of Hunting with Birds".</p>
                    <p class="red">Frederick included many drawings depicting the wide variety of birds from all around the known world to educate others on their behaviors.</p>
                    <p class="blue">The research done by Frederick for his manuscript he made some of the first mentions of bird migration, David Attenborugh noted in "Natural Curiosities"<a href="#ref5"><sup>5</sup></a> :</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p class="red">In (The Art of Falconry) suprisingly, there are entire chapters on the migration of birds.</p>
                            <p class="blue">His confidence came from the fact that, unlike his contemporaries, and those before him, he had actually observed birds in the field for himself.</p>
                        </blockquote>

                    </div>
                    <p class="red">As well as educating about zoology the there are many step by step guides on knots, catching & hatching eggs, and care for birds.</p>
                    <p class="blue">Frederick had up to fifty falconers in his court and routienly sent requests for exotic birds and would also send exotic birds as gifts to other monarchs.</p>
                    <p class="red">Upon recieving the earlier mentioned planetarium from al-Ashraf he sent an albino peacock and other exotic birds in return that the sultan enjoyed showing to his own court.<a href="#ref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
                    <p class="blue">He wrote his book not only to teach others about birds but it was also a gift to his son who was also an avid falconer.</p>

                <h5>
                    <p class="red">Within Europe Fredericks diplomatic skills were sub par leading to his excommunication from the Catholic Chruch a total of three times.</p>
                    <p class="blue">His true diplomacy came in his "crusade" when he retook Jerusalem by negotiating for it with the sultan al-Kamil to become the King of Jerusalem for 10 years.</p>
                    <p class="red">Of all the previous crusader kings few had beneficial negotiations like Frederick had with the Muslim Sultans nor did they speak Arabic as Frederick did.</p>
                    <p class="blue">His friendships with the Sultans went beyond political benefits as evidence by the gifts exchanged between them like exotic birds and the planetarium.</p>
                    <p class="red">Besides speaking Arabic he also spoke Latin, Sicilian, Middle High German, French, and Greek<a href="#ref7"><sup>7</sup></a> demonstrating his desire to understand outside perspectives and peoples.</p>

                    <p class="blue">Although Frederick II was the last of his family line his legacy has lasting impacts to today.</p>
                    <p class="red">In his book "Germany: a Short History"<a href="#ref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Donald Detwiler refrences his impact on the western world:</p>
                        <blockquote><p class="blue">A man of extraordinary culture, energy, and ability – called by a contemporary chronicler <i>stupor mundi</i> (the wonder of the world), by Nietzsche the first European, and by many historians the first modern ruler – Frederick established in Sicily and southern Italy something very much like a modern, centrally governed kingdom with an efficient bureaucracy.</p></blockquote>

                    <p class="blue">The University has both stood the test of time and continue educating more <i>stupor mundi</i>.</p>
                    <p class="red">Astronauts Samantha Cristoforetti (current ISS Commander) and Luca Parmitano were both graduates of University of Naples Fredrico II.</p>
                    <p class="blue">Frederick would be proud his school of science helped two of their students reach the heavens he tried to bring down to himself.</p>
